# WeChat  #

This plugin was developed thanks to funding from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn)

The plugin allows a site to connect to Wechat China using the PHP SDK available here:  
https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/api/jsapi.php?chapter=11_1
  
### Note: You must download the SDK and add it to the code prior to installing this plugin. ###

## Pre-install ##
The WeChat SDK is not distributed by WeChat with a valid open source license - unfortunately this means that we cannot 
pre-package the SDK within the Moodle plugin as this violates the GPL license so you must download it manually prior to installing this plugin.

The PHP SDK is available here:
https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/api/jsapi.php?chapter=11_1
This plugin has been tested with wechat php_sdk_v3.0.10

Copy the 5 files from the "lib" folder in the zip supplied above into the .extlib/wechatsdk folder in your plugin.
you should have the following files in the following location:
* /payment/gateway/wechat/.extlib/wechatsdk/WxPay.Api.php
* /payment/gateway/wechat/.extlib/wechatsdk/WxPay.Config.Interface.php
* /payment/gateway/wechat/.extlib/wechatsdk/WxPay.Data.php
* /payment/gateway/wechat/.extlib/wechatsdk/WxPay.Exception.php
* /payment/gateway/wechat/.extlib/wechatsdk/WxPay.Notify.php

Then install the plugin into your site like normal.
